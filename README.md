# Authentication plugin skeleton

This is merely a skeleton plugin that plugin developers can fork to get quickly started with writing authentication plugins for GoCD.

## Getting started

* Edit the file `build.gradle`
* Edit the `GetPluginConfigurationExecutor.java` class to add any configuration fields that should be shown in the view
* Edit the `plugin-settings.template.html` file which contains the view for the plugin settings page of your plugin
* Edit the `PluginSettings.java` file which contains the model for your settings
* Edit the `GetAuthPluginConfigurationExecutor.java` file which contains the information required by server
* Edit the `SetupLoginRequestExecutor.java` file class to render login page or oauth page
    * Refer `login-page.template.html` to customise login page
* Edit the `AuthenticationExecutor.java` and modify method [validateAndGetUser](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/authentication-skeleton-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/com/example/authentication/executors/AuthenticationExecutor.java#L69-L76) method as your need
* Edit the `SearchUserExecutor.java` and modify method [searchUsers](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/authentication-skeleton-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/com/example/authentication/executors/SearchUserExecutor.java#L49-L51)

## Building the code base

To build the jar, run `./gradlew clean test assemble`
